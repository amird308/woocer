# AI Credit Purchase System Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Implement a dual-credit system for our WooCommerce store management app where users can purchase additional AI credits that never expire, alongside their monthly subscription credits.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements Summary

### Core Features
- **Two Credit Types**: Monthly subscription credits (reset monthly) + Purchased credits (never expire)
- **Smart Usage Priority**: Use monthly credits first, then purchased credits
- **Tiered Pricing**: Volume discounts for larger credit packages
- **Cross-Platform**: Web (RevenueCat Web SDK), iOS, Android (RevenueCat SDK)
- **Single Source of Truth**: RevenueCat handles all payments and webhooks

### Business Rules
- Only **AI Plan** subscribers can purchase and use credits
- **Pro Plan** subscribers get 0 AI credits (no access to AI features)
- Monthly credits reset every month, purchased credits never expire
- Credits are consumed in order: Monthly â†’ Purchased


### Business Logic
- Only AI plan subscribers can purchase credits
- Pro plan users get 0 credits (blocked from AI features)
- Credits never expire once purchased
- Monthly credits reset on subscription renewal
